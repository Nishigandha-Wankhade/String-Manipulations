# String-Manipulations

**Problem One **
Currently, you have no way to count the number of times a substring matches within 
another string. To solve this problem, you will create two functions: countSubstrMatches 
and countSubstrRecursive. Both of these functions will take two arguments: a string to 
search and the substring you want to find.  
**def countSubstrMatches(srch_str, sub_str): 
""" 
Describe what the function does, what type of information goes 
into the arguments, and what is returned. 
"""  
def countSubstrRecursive(srch_str, sub_str): 
""" 
Describe what the function does, what type of information goes 
into the arguments, and what is returned. 
"""  **
Your functions will both use the method find to identify the matches. The first function will 
search iteratively. The second function will search recursively. While you are working on 
creating these functions, you must import the string library, understand the use of find, and  

**Figure 2 **
Examples Using the find Method in Python 
>>>"atatattta".find("ata")    
# search for substring ata 
0 
>>>"atatattta".find("ttt") 
5 
>>>"atatattta".find("ata", 1) # search for ata after index 0 
2 
>>>"python".find("Python")    -1 
# donâ€™t forget! case matters

(0, 2, 4) 
allMatchesIndices("atattatta", "Python")  
() 


**Problem Two **
The second problem is that you do not have a function that will collect the start positions 
of every match between a substring and a string. For this solution, you will create one function 
named allMatchesIndices. This function will require two arguments, the string you need to 
search and the substring you want to find. The function shall return a tuple of the start indices of 
all matches.  
**def allMatchesIndices(srch_str, sub_str): 
""" 
Describe what the function does, what type of information goes 
into the arguments, and what is returned. 
"""  **
Keep in mind indices start at zero. An example of the expected output is shown in Figure 3. 
Since the required output is a tuple, using an iterative method will probably be a far less 
complicated method for finding a solution.  


**Problem Three **
The third problem is that you need a way to search for fuzzy matches. For this solution, 
your goal is to find where all but one character in a substring match by creating a function named 
fuzzyMatching. For example, suppose the substring is abcd. In that case, positive matches 
include abc*, ab*d, a*cd, and *bcd (where * represents a wild card that any character can 
substitute). The function fuzzyMatching has three required arguments. The first argument is a 
tuple of matching start positions for the first substring (the tuple output of the function you 
created to solve the second problem). The second required argument is a tuple of the second 
substring. The length of the first substring is the third argument. The function returns a tuple of 
start positions of all fuzzy matches.  
**def fuzzyMatching(subOne, subTwo, subOneLen): 
""" 
Describe what the function does, what type of information goes 
into the arguments, and what is returned. 
"""  **
This is an example of what information is sent to this function and why it's necessary. If 
you wanted to find the fuzzy matches with "a*cd" as the substring, then "a" and "cd" are the 
substrings. The tuple of the first substring can be collected by using the solution to problem two,  
allMatchesIndices("abcdefgabad", "a") which returns the tuple (0, 7, 9). The 
second substring is allMatchesIndices("abcdefgabad", "cd") which returns the tuple 
(2, ). The first substring's length can be collected using len("a"), which returns 1. These are 
the arguments for the function that solve this problem. 
fuzzyMatching((0, 7, 9), (2, ), len("a")) 
Add the length of the first substring "a" and the number of wild cards to each of the start 
positions in the first tuple (this would equate to 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, 7 + 1 + 1 = 9, and 9 + 1 
+ 1 = 11), if any of the totals are equivalent to a value found in the second tuple, then keep the 
corresponding value in the first tuple (in this example, since 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 and there is a 2 in 
the second tuple, retain the 0 from the first tuple). There is only one match (fuzzy or otherwise) 
in the string. The returned tuple for the example is (0,). Position zero in the string is the starting 
point of the only match (abcd is fuzzy matched to a*cd).


**Problem Four **
The fourth and final problem is that the solution to problem three returns exact and fuzzy 
matches. The solution to this program is to create a function named fuzzyMatchesOnly that 
only returns string matches that are not an exact match. This function has two required 
arguments, the string that will be searched and a substring that you want to find. The output of 
this function is a tuple that provides the start position of fuzzy matches where one character is 
incorrect. (The returned tuple will not contain the start positions of exact matches.) Considering 
the solutions to problems 2 and 3, you may find that you have already done most of the work to 
solve this problem.  
**def fuzzyMatchesOnly(srch_str, sub_str): 
""" 
Describe what the function does, what type of information goes 
into the arguments, and what is returned.
